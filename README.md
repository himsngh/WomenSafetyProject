**Abstract:**

The world is becoming so much more unsafe for women. It is high time that we equip ourselves to deal with the predators out there. Neither women nor their families need to worry about the time or places when they go out.

In this project, we create a website. If the woman feels endangered, then she has to press the button. This sends an SOS signal to police, family and people nearby. People nearby (potential helpers) will have to register to a website and their location will be uploaded to the server on a real-time basis. When SOS button is pressed a message will be sent to people in around ~100m range (Technology is similar to Uber)

This project will reduce the time which is required for someone to get help.

**Introduction:**

As technology is taking over the world with each passing day, with developed countries optimizing it, India is also gradually embracing and adopting the advantages it brings along, especially with regard to ensuring women&#39;s safety across the country.

For starters, several states have launched and currently operate the 181 and 112 emergency helpline numbers to provide relief to women in distress, whether it is in a public place, at home or even their workplace.

Furthermore, several robust applications have been launched by the government that can be accessed on the mobile, and serve as security guards for women, to keep them safe in every possible situation. These include Eyewatch SOS for Women, SpotnSave Feel secure, iGoSafely, Smart 24×7, bSafe, Shake2Safety, Trakie, My SafetyPin, and many more.

As travel safety has been a major concern with respect to women, there exist, GPS trackers that can be used by women, including those belonging to the working class to keep their near and dear ones in the loop of their whereabouts, especially when traveling late at night. Moreover, smart navigation through applications like Uber and Ola, which work closely with the police, help ensure the safety of female passengers and drivers. These applications have upgraded functions and response teams that are always available for users, with a zero-tolerance policy with regard to harassment and injustice against women.

This project focuses on the women safety by using the existing technology so that the time taken to get a help can be reduced. The project can be divided into three parts.

Then user has to initialize this app as a &quot;widget&quot; It will also record voice in the region of surrounds for 45 seconds and then save this recording. It also sends the position | Research paper | To generate the Alert Message, when victim pressany key of her mobile automatically capturing real time image andrecording audio, Sending SMS with location detailsand images to selected contacts when victim is introuble, automatically converting profile of mobilephone to silent mode, Auto-call receiving System,GPS tracker, Detection of Spy Camera. | In this app, there are two modules. One for Hidden Camera Detection System for detecting cameras placed in areas like hospital, colleges, Malls, Hotel rooms etc. Another module for women attacks Handler System. |

The experiments were performed using android mobile with the support of Wi-Fi. In the development of the I safety mobile app the software requirements are Front End is Android Application, Web Application is Servlet Java development kit 1.6.0 or above, Eclipse IDE for Android Connective Wi-Fi router software | Research Paper | The call sending is done by simply touching the option SOS from main screen then it retrieves the contacts which are saved in the JSON database. it performs the action and at the same time it sends the location URL of the person through the message format where she/he used this application when they are in danger. Another important option from main screen is Fake call, video call and first aid information

 | This mobile application is helpful in future when any problem arises in travelling or any kind of situations. As the technology emerges, it is possible to upgrade the system and can be adaptable to desired environment. Because it is based on object-oriented design, any further changes can be easily adaptable. Based on the future security issues, security can be improved using emerging technologies. |

We cansend our location to our family members and police stations byshaking mobile. Also, system send messages to nearby peopleswho are all having this app. Overall system works for the safetyof the women |

**Methodology:**

Our Project works on the basic idea of helping women, who notice or feel any ambiguous behaviour around them. The amount of violence against Women has increased a lot due to their exposure to different fields of work. It is a shame that rapes take place very frequently. It is an evil that has no boundaries. Therefore, to cater to the need for women&#39;s safety We have designed and created a website through which people who are willing to protect women can take part in the initiative and help us achieve our goal, to make India a women-friendly India. We have created a website that has two parts. The First part is the helper&#39;s login, people who want to help women can sign up on our website, we will store some of their private details and hence they become part of our community. Other part of the website contains a portal for women who can sign up, if they feel they want any sort of people. The website front –end will be created by  **HTML, CSS, and React Js.**  Women who want to part of the community and they feel that we can help them have to install an application, which can be made through  **MIT App Inventor. ** Our application consists of a help button. If the women feel any sort of danger or strange behaviour of anyone around them, they can click on the help button. After clicking the help button their location gets uploaded on the website. Then this location is compared with the live location of people who have registered on our portal as helpers. The people with the closest location from the woman or the people who are in the 1km radius to the woman receives a message on their cell phone. In the message there will be a link, on clicking the link it shows the location of the woman in help on google maps. For all the backend work we use Node JS, and the database we use for storing all the information is firebase.

**Tools and techniques:**

1. We use HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make the website front end, which is basically the registration portal.
2. Registration portal uploads registration data including location and name to firebase database using node.js and express.js framework.
3. Firebase acts as a database as well as a Backend as a service (BaaS).
4. We use JSON objects to move data between server and database.

The following is the process of initiating help-

1. Press the button.

2. Location is sent to &quot;Women safety database&quot;

3. Potential helper list is prepared

4. Message is sent to people around with location

**Website Portal:**

This facilitates service for helpers to submit their details voluntarily to our server. This portal needs them to first sign up in &quot;sign up section&quot;, and then submit their details. Submitted details can be modified by logging in to the &quot;login section&quot;.

**Server code:**

Server code is the brain of the project. It collects real-time data from database and calculates distance between women who needs help and people nearby who could help. This also sends a message to the filtered groups of people who could help along with women location.

_Following are the functions performed by server file,_

• Connect to firebase database

• Retrieve women location

• Retrieve helper location and mobile number

• Calculate distance between different locations

• Message filtered mobile numbers with location

**Database:**

This contains all the information of registered users with their location, name, email, mobile number. This also contains women location in real-time.
